# Github templates

Issue and Pull Request templates

## About

This is boilerplate. It contains example issue templates and an example pull request template that should be fully realized enough to use as-is or with little modification in your project.

Templates like these can improve productivity by improving communication: making sure that issues are fully documented, making sure pull requests include documentation, tests, etc.

If you're working by yourself on a project, you probably don't need this. (Unless you just *really* like process.) If you're working with a couple people, then this could help. If you plan on open sourcing your project and/or accepting contributions from the public, then you should really consider using this.

## Installation

Two scenarios:

1. You are starting a new project from scratch.

    Just clone this repo into a new directory and get to hacking.

2. You have already started a project and want to add templates to it now.

    Clone this repo somewhere, and copy the files over to your existing project.

## Usage

Your templates can be living documents. Update them and add to them as needed/desired.

## Contents

This boilerplate includes the following.

### Readme

Every project needs a Readme file. It should at minimum include the following.

```markdown
# Name of project
one line description

## About
longer description, background, context, etc

## Installation
Dependencies, set up, how to get started, gotchas

## Usage
How to use the damn thing
```

### Pull request template

(See it in action. Try submitting a PR to this repo.)

Here's where you can ask for all the things you know you want out of a pull request.

You can make a checklist of things.

- [ ] This PR includes documentation of the feature it adds
- [ ] I ran the linter
- [ ] I ran the tests
- [ ] I included new tests for the new feature.

Sky's the limit here.

### Issue templates

(See them in action. Raise an issue on this repo.)

Super helpful.

You can include a template for as many kinds of issues as you like. You can apply labels, assign people, suggest all kinds of documentation on a bug, etc.

## Roadmap

Other things to add to a project (and which might be added to this repo in the future) that can help improve communication and make working with other people more enjoyable/efficient include a code of conduct, a contributions guideline, a license, and a changelog. You might consider enforcing conventional commits.
